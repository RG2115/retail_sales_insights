# retail_sales_insights
This particular project deals with sales insight based on the yearly analysis provided by the particular database used.
The required database was taken from a Git repository available online.
After downloading and loading the data into an Excel sheet, I was able to complete all the cleaning processes with the help of OpenAI and other help available online.
Then I uploaded the database in Excel to SQL by converting the '.xlsx' file into a '.csv' file, and then Server< Data-Import and drop the path of the file in **import from dump project folder** bubble and tap **select import** button.
Once the data is imported successfully, open a new Query file and perform the operations mentioned in another README file.
After the hectic process open **Tableau Desktop** and under TO A SERVER select MySQL and login to your root in MySQL login.
Once a connection has been established, select sales database from **database** dropdown menu.

I put up the relations as shown in the image, then created worksheets for different aspects like Revenue, Quantity, Revenue by Market etc..,
For the dashboard creation I joined all the worksheets with the Sheets option and made a meaningful visualization.
For a particular insight select the sheet and click on the filter option, this will result in showing visualization for a particular aspect selected.
