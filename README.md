I first imported a zip file from an online GIT Repository

Then the zip file has been imported to SQL workbench with the help of the **Import data** option from the Server dropdown menu.

After importing the data I performed the operations mentioned in the **another_README.md** file.

Once the joining of require tables is done to check for the totals, open **Tableau Desktop**.

On the home page, go to **MySQL** in the **To a Server** column.

Login to the server with your root password, the port is 3306 which is the default.

Once login is completed, select the sales database from the **database dropdown**.

Connect the columns as shown in the image and click on **Upload automatically** , if the data hasn't been updated under columns.

After establishing a relationship of primary key and foreign key between the tables, work on creating different worksheets.

At last design a dashboard which can accomidate all the worksheets developed and provide a meaningful visualization.

If you want to check the visualization for a particular parameter, select the respective worksheet on dashboard and click on the filter option.
